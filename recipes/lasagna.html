        <h3>Let's go!</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over 
                medium heat until well browned. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, 
                tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 
                1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, 
                for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in 
                    boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. 
                    In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons 
                    parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups 
                    of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise 
                    over meat sauce. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the 
                    mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle 
                    with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. 
                    Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make 
                    sure the foil does not touch the cheese.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil 
                    and bake for an additional 25 minutes. Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving
                </p>
